# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

This repository contains a web app for managing daily schedules using a work day scheduler. 
The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours from 9am to 5pm.
3. When I view the time blocks for the day, each block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. When I click into a time block, I can enter an event.
5. When I click the save button for a time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
6. When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (jQuery)
